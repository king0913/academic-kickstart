With [Nora Cate Schaeffer](https://sociology.wisc.edu/staff/schaeffer-nora-cate-2/), I designed (and twice served as a Teaching Assistant) for an intermediate methods course on surveys. I served as the instructor for the lab portion of the course which was organized to help students develop the skills and apply the concepts they learned in class. 

Approximately one-third of the class focuses on questions of how to represent a population, specifically focusing on basic concepts of sampling and study design. The majority of the course focuses on measurement, including best practices for refining concepts, writing questions, and evaluating questions. The course concludes with a shorter module about study design and fielding surveys.

Over the course of the semester, students write four research reports covering practical skills including sampling frame evaluation, analysis of a split ballot experiment, evaluation and revision of survey questions, and a proposal for a split ballot experiment. See the links above for a detailed course syllabus as well as sample lab slides and a sample assignment.

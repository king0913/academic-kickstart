My teaching philosophy is heavily influenced by my time spent teaching college chemistry, where I worked closely with a science education specialist to understand the pedagogical theories and practices that enable students to develop strong critical thinking and problem solving skills. I translate those ideals to my sociology teaching, where I firmly believe in the need for stronger active learning exercises and more flexible teaching approaches.

While at UW-Madison, I have taught in a number of different capacities. I have served as an instructor for undergraduate introductory statistics and for the last three years, I have co-taught an intensive refresher course on introductory statistics for incoming graduate students to prepare them for more advanced coursework. I have also served as a teaching assistant for Introductory Survey Methodology twice, where I helped design the curriculum for the first-time offering of the course.

Before coming to UW-Madison, I served as a teaching assistant in various sociology courses at the University of Montana including Social Statistics; Research Methods; and Race, Class, and Gender. As mentioned above, I also spent 5 years as part of the teaching team for General Chemistry, covering nearly all roles in the course from lecturing, to leading discussion sections, to facilitating lab, to training and evaluating new teaching assistants.

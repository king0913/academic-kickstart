I am a PhD candidate in [Sociology](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/soc/) and an affiliate of the [Center for Demography and Ecology](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

My research interests include social stratification, social demography, family, education, and survey methodology. My dissertation examines how social mobility and educational attainment influence family formation processes, including marriage and assortative mating.
